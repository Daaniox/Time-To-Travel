<img src="Sea.jpg" alt="sea" width="400px">
<p> This is maya bay. This has been closed for the last two years due to covid. Recently it has reopened.
<br></br>The beach is mainly famous for being the site where the Hollywood film 'the beach' was filmed.
<br></br> It is incredibly picturesque with the crystral clear sea and soft white sand. </p>

<img src="Temple_thailand.jpg" alt="bangkok" width="400px" height="300px">
<p dis>This picture was taken in Bangkok. Even though it is a large city, there are still many beauty spots in the country.
  <br></br> This temple in the picture is named Wat Arun, it was build in the 1800's.
  <br></br> It is called the "temple of dawn" and is much loved among thai buddhists.
  <br></br> The best time to capture a picture here is at dawn, when the sun bounces off the walls of the temple.
</p>

<img src="Tailboat.jpg" alt="boat" width="400px">
<p>This picture is a tail boat. These are often used to move around the different islands in the country.
  <br></br>  They were designed to sit low in the water, ideal for beaching on the sand.
  <br></br> They have been known to cope with the rough sea surprisingly well due to the high bow
</p>

<img src="whitetemple" alt="white-temple" width="400px">
<p> This is the White Temple in chang pai, the statues and sculptures around this are actually tiny litte hands which are everywhere.
  <br></br> The actual name for the Temple is Wat Rong Khun, construction began in 1997.
  <br></br>There was a contest held to determine who would design and build the temple.
